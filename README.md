# Laravel Breeze with Next.js and TypeScript


## Introduction

This repository combines the power of Laravel Breeze, Next.js, and TypeScript to create a seamless web application development experience. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex e-commerce platform, this setup provides a solid foundation.

## Features

- Authentication: Laravel Breeze offers a lightweight authentication system out of the box. You can easily customize it to fit your needs.

- Next.js: The frontend is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and optimized performance.

- TypeScript: Type safety and better code organization are crucial. TypeScript ensures both by adding static types to your JavaScript.

- Code Quality Tools:
  - Husky: Set up Git hooks to run checks (such as linting and testing) before committing code.
  - ESLint: Keep your code consistent and error-free with ESLint rules.
  - Prettier: Automatically format your code for consistency.
